## How to Use
Windows are draggable, and some, like the image window (which shows a cat by default) or the notes window, can be resized. Windows can be closed using the red button in the top-left corner. To open a window, click on its corresponding icon in the top-left menu. If the window is already open, this action will have no effect.

### Windows
1. Notes app: A simple text area. Note (pun intended :)) that information will not be saved.
2. Question window: Simply asks a single question.
3. Countdown: A countdown timer to a specific date and time.
4. Spaces: Change the background to a preset or a custom one using the button in the top-right corner.
5. Pomodoro and Timer: Choose between countdown mode (Pomodoro) or count-up mode (Timer) using the top-left button. Includes pause, reset, and other basic functions.
6. Image window: Select any image using the top-left button in the window; it will be displayed inside. The default image is a cat.
7. YouTube iframe: Embed a YouTube video. Keep in mind that some videos donâ€™t allow this feature.
